"You are a malware analyst. From the provided document labeled as INPUT_TEXT, your task is to extract structured information from it in the form of triplet for constructing a knowledge graph. Each tuple should be in the form of ('h', 'type',    'r', 'o', 'type'), where 'h' stands for the head entity, 'r' for the relationship, and 'o' for the tail entity. The 'type' denotes the category of the corresponding entity. Do NOT include redundant triplets, NOT include triplets with relationship that occurs in the past\n"
"Note that the entities should not be generic, numerical or temporal (like dates or percentages). Entities must be classified into the following categories:\n"
"EXE: Executable files downloaded or created. They can be VB scripts, bash scripts, powershell scripts (ps1), DLLs, msi, exe, bat, COM or other executables in Windows.\n"
"PATH: File directories created or accessed or checked by the script.\n"
"URL: URL mentioned in the text.\n"
"IP: IP addresses mentioned in the text.\n"
"FILE: Non-executables or encrypted files created or accessed by the script.\n"
"WAPI: Windows API (e.g., “Virtual Alloc”). \n"
"REGKEY: Registry key (e.g., 'HKCU:\\Software\\AppDataLow\\Software\\Microsoft\\98A2C439-17C5-8A1F-614C-3B5E25409F72')\n"
"COMMAND: Powershell commands (e.g., 'Invoke-Expression','IEX','start-job','Invoke-WebRequest')\n"
"PARAMETER: Parameters of Powershell commands (e.g.,'-RunAs32','-NoNewWindow','-enc','-noP','-sta','-nop','-NoProfile','-ep bypass','-exec bypass','-EncodedCommand','-ExecutionPolicy Bypass')\n"
"LOOP: A while loop with `while(1)` to run indefinitely\n"
"PVI: Private Information (e.g., Screenshot, Webcam, Browser,Username,Password,Keylogging,MAC address)\n"
"SLEEP: Random sleep or idle to bypass the detection\n"
"OBF: Obfuscated payloads (e.g. 'XOR', 'hexadecimal','Base64')\n"
"SUB: The powershell script analysed in this text, noted as ‘the script’\n"
"ERR: The error checking or handling described in the text \n"
"PROCESS: Windows process checked or killed by the script \n"
"PERMISSION: User permission modified by the script (e.g. the script uses 'sudo' to request the administrator's permission). \n"
"DEFENDER: Windows defender service (e.g. Antimalware Scan Interface,SmartScreen filter,Application Layer Security,Windows Firewall,AMSI,AntiVirus Engine like Norton)"
"The relationships 'r' between these entities must be represented by one of the following relation verbs set: Has, Execute, Hosted, Download, Upload, Collect, Connect and Contact, Access, Write, Save, Delete, Encrypt, Wait, Hide, Terminate, Escalate, Disable.\n"
"Your output should strictly be in a list format of triplets in the JSON list format of ('h', 'type', 'r', 'o', 'type'), where the relationship 'r' must be in the given relation verbs set above. You SHOULD only response with the list of the tuples. You can propose new entities and relations if you don't find match.\n"
"As an Example, consider the following news excerpt:\n"
"The script writes a PowerShell script (Report.ps1) to the public user Music folder, which is then executed using PowerShell '-ExecutionPolicy Bypass' to bypass any execution policy restrictions.\n"
"From this text, your output should be:\n"
"[(‘The script’, ’SUB’, ‘Write’, ‘Report.ps1’, ‘EXE’),\n"
"(‘Report.ps1’, ‘EXE’, ’SAVE’, ‘the public user’s Music folder’, ‘PATH’),\n"
"(‘Report.ps1’, ‘EXE’, ‘Has’, ‘-ExecutionPolicy Bypass’, ‘PARAMETER’)]\n"
"INPUT_TEXT:\n"
